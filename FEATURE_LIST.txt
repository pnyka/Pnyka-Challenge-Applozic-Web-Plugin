Feature 1: 

User Story: As a user, I want to feel more prepared for the discussion. Reading
relevant articles, watching news stories, documentaries, etc. would better enable
me to contribute to the conversation. Additionally, I want time before the
discussion to fit in consuming and digesting these pieces of information into my
schedule.

Explain why you chose this as a top 3 choice: This was listed in the "recurring 
comments" section, and as I read through the individual rounds I saw that echoed
as well. It wouldn't feel great to join a conversation you don't have an opinion 
on or knowledge to share about it. 

Estimate how long it would take to implement the feature (break this down as best you can):
- lead time of someone sourcing information (Pynka employee or user?) this is recurring
    - if user, lead time of someone checking over information to make sure it covers
    both sides and is relevant
    - ~2 hours/topic for well researched/vetted info
- implement area of website where information can be shared x-hours/days before
discussion begins for each topic/sub-topic. this should persist throughout and 
possibly afterwards conversation in an archive
- ~3 hours
- pin either a link to the page or all of the links at the top of the chat room
- ~1 hour

Devise acceptance criteria for the feature:
- Have an easy to use and access page for each upcoming topic with
links to relevant information on the topic
- This page should show the date of the upcoming conversation (if decided)
- After the discussion has ended, this should be archived into a "past discussions"
section
- Could potentially use the "Context (Topic) based Chat" feature of Applozic
  for each subtopic

Feature 2: 

User Story: As a user, I want to talk with people who have different views than
me so I can learn about the other sides to an issue. Ideally there would be a 
50/50 split on for/against, but this isn't a hard and fast rule.

Explain why you chose this as a top 3 choice: It isn't very constructive to have
a conversation with people who agree with you on everything, so by ensuring that
there is an even(ish) break down of users with various views on a topic before
the discussion begins, you will have a more fruitful experience. Again, this was
echoed multiple times in the feedback.

Estimate how long it would take to implement the feature (break this down as best you can):

- ~4 hours to implement timers based on a criteria


Devise acceptance criteria for the feature:
I believe that it's already spec'ed to have the users say whether they're 
for/neutral/against a topic, so:
- Put a gate on the conversation opening until there are enough people
on both sides. 
(However, there may be a bottleneck if that simply doesn't happen,
so you could:)
- Enforce a time limit on this i.e. if you get enough people on both sides,
 the discussion is scheduled, but if you don't get enough people within
X days/hours, it still opens up, but a disclaimer is shown to users
- nice to have: in the topic description, show a dynamic pie chart of positions 
of people who've signed up for the discussion.

Feature 3: 

User Story: As a user, it's difficult for me to jump back into a conversation
after being idle for a while. I want a way to get quickly caught up on the key
points that I've missed. I'd also like the ability to like/dislike comments so that
when I come back, I can quickly see the highest rated comments.

Explain why you chose this as a top 3 choice: Here I'm combining 2 pieces of user
feedback into one feature - like/dislike buttons and people expressing hardship in
getting back into the conversation. The latter seems like a very large issue - the
user might just give up and not contribute anymore if they feel like they are unable
to catch back up without spending a significant amount of time.

Estimate how long it would take to implement the feature (break this down as best you can):

- implement like/dislike buttons
    - choose art for icons
    - on 2 finger click of a message you currently have some options, add "like" 
      and "dislike" options here
    - below each message, show number of likes followed by a smaller version of the icon
    - below each message, show number of dislikes followed by a smaller version of the icon
- ~3 hours

- implement button to show highest rated comments
- ~3 hours 

Devise acceptance criteria for the feature:
- user can easily click on a comment and like or dislike it
- comment shows how many likes and dislikes it received
- user can easily click on a button to see top/bottom rated comments to get up to speed
on conversation
