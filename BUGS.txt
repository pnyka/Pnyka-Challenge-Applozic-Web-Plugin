- When the user does a 2-finger click on a message to bring up the context menu,
  they cannot click away to make the menu close. The only way to close the menu
  is to choose an option.
- Impact on the user is high, it's pretty annoying and no good way to get out 
  of it.
- A solution would be to add the ability to close the menu when you click anywhere
  that isn't one of the menu options.
